## Welcome to the fun online minigame inspired by JKLM!

Start by inviting your friends either through a code or the url link!

## About Guess the Imposter
The game's core ideas are very simple:
```
    1) Everyone is given a word except for the imposter 
       who is only given the category of the word.

    2) Every round, each person in the game gets to describe 1 attribute 
       about the object

    3) The imposter must try to blend in by making good guesses and the normal players
       must try to guess the imposter in under a certain amount of rounds
       
    4) Experiment with gamemodes and have fun getting suspicious of all your friends...!
```


## We currently support multiple gamemodes such as
```
     1) All imposters
     Everyone is an imposter

     2) No imposters
     No one is the imposter

     3) Lone Normal
     Everyone is an imposter except for 1 person

     4) Multiple Imposters
     There are more than 1 imposter (but less than 50% of players)

     5) Word Shuffle
     Each normal player is give a different word from the same category

     6) Word Swap
     Everyone is normal but there are 2 words split amongst players

     7) Double Agent
     Someone is randomly assigned as a Double Agent who knows the word and the imposter
     However, their life is tied to the imposter and must protect them

     8) The Chameleon
     The Chameleon is give a word from the same category as everyone but a different word
     Try to blend in as the reverse imposter

     9) The Mirror
     The Mirror is randomly assigend a normal player and must copy what the normal player said but differently
